You can use both together!"

        answer: "AI editing tools use smart algorithms to analyze your image and apply enhancements automatically, often requiring just one click.

    },
    {
        question: "What's the difference between AI photo editing and AI image editing?",

AI image editing is a broader term that covers all types of visual content, including creating graphics from text, editing illustrations, generating artwork, and manipulating non-photographic images.

    },
    {
        question: "What is a photo combiner AI?",
        answer: "A photo combiner AI is a smart tool that uses artificial intelligence to merge multiple photos into a single, seamless image.
